# HSC 2022 Q16 b)

This is just a really simple simulation that can be used to find out the answer 
to Question 16 part (b) in the 2022 HSC Extension 2 Exam. 
It can provide a good estimation of the answer by trial-and-error, 
measuring the time of flight of projectiles with varying *v<sub>0</sub>* values.
As the measured time of flight approaches 7 seconds, 
the adjusted launching velocity used to run each trial 
should also approach the *v<sub>0</sub>* value required.

The parameters can be changed to suite one's needs and computational powers.
